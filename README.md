# RTD-Signal-Conditioning-Circuit
In this I am designing two circuits with  instrumentational and differential amplifier. I am designing signal conditioning circuit for RTD such  that for 25 C it gives 0V and for 100 C it gives 5V. and for 0 C it gives 0V and for 100C it gives 5V.

## Results
The Signal conditioning circuit for the given problem is 
designed with the help of instrumentation amplifier. 
Instrumentation amplifier is used as signal conditioning 
circuit. The gain can be varied as per the given input. Here we designed a circuit such that for 25 C we get 0V and for 100 C 
we get 5V
